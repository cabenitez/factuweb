Installation instructions.

1. Copy the entire calendar into whatever directory you want.
2. Create your database and import the 'databaseSQL.sql' file into it, this will create the default data for running it.
3. Alter the 'databaseConnection.php' file to show your connection details.

That should be it..

NOTE: 
By default the username and password are both 'admin' (without the quotes), i suggest you change your password in the control panel.
