STATUS
    Currently, it is able to print on an IPP server, parses server's response,
    is able to cancel jobs, and do all REQUIRED operations from RFC2911.


LIMITATIONS
    - SSL/TLS may work, but is not tested

DOCUMENTATION      
    Complete documentation is in "./documentation".

ORIGIN
    It is inspired by "PrintSendLPR", by Mick Sear, but there is no more code
    of it in. If you search for a very basic print client, uses it :)
    PrintSendLPR is available at http://www.phpclasses.org (license: LGPL).
    
TESTS
    Usage exemple is given in "TEST_PrintIPP.php".
    Test files are distributed under GPL.

Enjoy !
